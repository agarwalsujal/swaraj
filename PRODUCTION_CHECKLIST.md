# ✅ Production Readiness Checklist

This checklist ensures your Node.js backend is ready for real users, not just localhost. Tick off each item as you complete it!

---

## 1. Core Features (Done ✅)

- [x] Project structure set up (`routes/`, `controllers/`, `models/`, `middlewares/`)
- [x] Authentication
  - [x] Email + Password (JWT)
  - [x] Google OAuth integration
- [x] Subscription Management (plans, subscribe, cancel)
- [x] AI Query handling with Azure OpenAI API
- [x] PostgreSQL Models (`User`, `Subscription`, `Log`)
- [x] Rate limiting & Error handling middleware

---

## 2. Environment & Config

- [x] `.env` file template created
- [ ] Secure secrets in **production** (don’t hardcode, use vaults or env vars)
- [ ] Separate **dev** and **prod** configs (CORS, logging, API keys)

---

## 3. Database

- [ ] Run migrations for PostgreSQL (using `sequelize`, `knex`, or `prisma`)
- [ ] Add seed data for testing (admin user, sample plans)
- [ ] Enable DB connection pooling for production
- [ ] Backup strategy (`pg_dump`, automated backup)

---

## 4. Security

- [ ] Hash passwords with bcrypt
- [ ] Store JWT secret securely (not in code)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production (SSL cert via Nginx / Cloudflare)
- [ ] Helmet middleware for secure headers
- [ ] Validate all inputs (Joi / Zod / express-validator)
- [ ] CSRF protection (if serving frontend)

---

## 5. Testing

- [ ] Unit tests for controllers & services (Jest / Mocha)
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints (Supertest)
- [ ] Mock Azure OpenAI API calls in tests
- [ ] Test OAuth login flow

---

## 6. Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] Structured logging (winston / pino)
- [ ] Error logging to file / cloud (Logtail, Datadog, Elastic, etc.)
- [ ] Health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
- [ ] Request metrics (response time, error rate)

---

## 7. Deployment

- [ ] Dockerize the app (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar)
- [ ] Production server (AWS EC2, Azure App Service, Vercel, etc.)
- [ ] Reverse proxy (Nginx / Caddy) with HTTPS
- [ ] Environment secrets managed via cloud (AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault)

---

## 8. Scalability & Performance

- [ ] Rate limiter tested under load (e.g. k6 / JMeter)
- [ ] Connection pooling enabled in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Caching layer (Redis) for frequently used queries (like subscription plans)
- [ ] Queue system (BullMQ / RabbitMQ) for background jobs (like logging queries, sending emails)

---

## 9. Docs & Developer Experience

- [ ] API docs with Swagger / Postman Collection
- [ ] README updated (setup, usage, deployment steps)
- [ ] `.env.example` file for new developers
- [ ] Prettier + ESLint for consistent code style

---

## 10. Optional (Enterprise-Ready)

- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Audit logs (track user actions, subscription changes)
- [ ] Multi-provider OAuth (GitHub, Microsoft, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Webhooks for subscription events (e.g. notify frontend or external service)

---

⚡ By checking all of this off, your project won’t just “run” — it will be **production-grade**.
