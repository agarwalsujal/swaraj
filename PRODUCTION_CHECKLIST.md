# ✅ Production Read## 2. Environment & Config

- ## Testing

- [x] Unit tests for controllers & services (Jest / Mocha)
- [x] Integration tests for API endpoints (Supertest)
- [x] Mock Gemini API calls in tests
- [ ] Test OAuth login flowenv` file template created
- [x] Secure secrets in **production** (don't hardcode, use vaults or env vars)
- [x] Separate **dev** and **prod** configs (CORS, logging, API keys) Checklist

This checklist ensures your Node.js backend is ready for real users, not just localhost. Tick off each item as you complete it!

---

## 2. Environment & Config

- [x] `.env` file template created
- [ ] Secure secrets in **production** (don’t hardcode, use vaults or env vars)
- [ ] Separate **dev** and **prod** configs (CORS, logging, API keys)

---

## 3. Database

- [x] Run migrations for PostgreSQL (using `sequelize`, `knex`, or `prisma`)
- [x] Add seed data for testing (admin user, sample plans)
- [x] Enable DB connection pooling for production
- [ ] Backup strategy (`pg_dump`, automated backup)

---

## 4. Security

- [x] Store JWT secret securely (not in code)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS in production (SSL cert via Nginx / Cloudflare)
- [x] Helmet middleware for secure headers
- [x] Validate all inputs (Joi / Zod / express-validator)
- [ ] CSRF protection (if serving frontend)

---

## 5. Testing

- [x] Unit tests for controllers & services (Jest / Mocha)
- [x] Integration tests for API endpoints (Supertest)
- [x] Mock Gemini API calls in tests
- [ ] Test OAuth login flow

---

## 6. Logging & Monitoring

- [x] Structured logging (winston / pino)
- [x] Error logging to file / cloud (Logtail, Datadog, Elastic, etc.)
- [x] Health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
- [x] Request metrics (response time, error rate)

---

## 7. Deployment

- [x] Dockerize the app (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or similar)
- [ ] Production server (AWS EC2, Azure App Service, Vercel, etc.)
- [ ] Reverse proxy (Nginx / Caddy) with HTTPS
- [x] Environment secrets managed via cloud (AWS Secrets Manager / Azure Key Vault)

---

## 8. Scalability & Performance

- [ ] Rate limiter tested under load (e.g. k6 / JMeter)
- [x] Connection pooling enabled in PostgreSQL
- [ ] Caching layer (Redis) for frequently used queries (like subscription plans)
- [ ] Queue system (BullMQ / RabbitMQ) for background jobs (like logging queries, sending emails)

---

## 9. Docs & Developer Experience

- [x] API docs with Swagger / Postman Collection
- [x] README updated (setup, usage, deployment steps)
- [x] `.env.example` file for new developers
- [x] Prettier + ESLint for consistent code style

---

## 10. Optional (Enterprise-Ready)

- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Audit logs (track user actions, subscription changes)
- [ ] Multi-provider OAuth (GitHub, Microsoft, LinkedIn)
- [ ] Webhooks for subscription events (e.g. notify frontend or external service)
